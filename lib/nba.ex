defmodule Nba do
  @moduledoc """
  nba.com uses a large number of undocumented JSON endpoints to provide
  the statistics tables and charts displayed therein. This library
  provides an Elixir client for interacting with many of those API
  endpoints.

  `nba` is built from two JSON files at compile time â€” one containing
  information on the API endpoints, and one containing a list of
  players. You can configure the paths of the files that `nba` reads:

  ```
  config :nba, endpoint_json_path: "/Users/me/my/custom/path/endpoints.json"
  config :nba, player_json_path: "/Users/me/my/custom/path/players.json"
  ```
  Now you don't have to wait until I publish a release to fix endpoint
  issues, update the player list for the new season, or tweak the
  default parameter values, among other things. Keep in mind that the
  shape of the data must stay the same (see `data/players.json` and
  `data/endpoints.json` on GitHub).

  @doc """
  Returns the JSON encoding library, which by default is Jason.

  To configure this application to use another JSON encoding library,
  namely Poison, include the following in your `config/config.exs`:

      config :nba, :json_library, Poison
